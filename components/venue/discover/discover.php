                        Looking for a party by the beach? The Flying Pig Noordwijk is right in the centre of the popular Beach town Noordwijk, only 50mtr from the beautiful coastline. The Flying Pig Noordwijk is an excellent alternative for backpackers who want to see more of the Netherlands than just Amsterdam. Being centrally located between the major Netherlands cities of Rotterdam, Den Haag (The Hague), Leiden, Haarlem and Amsterdam, makes it an ideal base to explore the Netherlands’ most interesting cities.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                         These cities are easily reached by reliable Dutch public transport and we offer you a shuttle service into Amsterdam up to four times a day (see our shuttle schedule). Then return to the beach hostel for sunbathing, relaxing on the beach and a nice home cooked meal by the hostel.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                         Keen for a big night? The hostels’ beach bar is open all night and we play a wide variety of epic music. Our Flying Pig Beach parties are known to go on until early hours of the morning - and they offer you a great chance to meet your fellow backpackers!
