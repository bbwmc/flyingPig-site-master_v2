                              You can only book with a credit or debit card (Visa or MasterCard) to which we charge 10% deposit or you can choose to pay in full so you don't have to worry about payments upon arrival! If you choose to pay a 10% deposit you need to pay the remaining amount upon arrival, in cash or by card, that's up to you.

                              If you cancel too late (within those 24 hours) we will do our best to sell your bed to someone else but if that is unsuccessful we will need to charge the amount of the first night and cancel the remaining booking.

                              A Queensize bunk is a bunk bed 120 cm wide for 2 people. These bunks are in dorms (not a private room). They can only be booked per bed and are cheaper than a single bed (for couples or friends who fancy sharing).
